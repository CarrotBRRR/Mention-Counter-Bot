# Mention Counter Bot
Developed by: Dominic Choi (CarrotBRRR)

If you're wondering why the commits are directly onto the main branch, 
this is because I'm the only developer working on the bot, 
so I don't need to make new branches, since I will never
get merge conflicts

## Current Features
- Fill this out eventually

## TODO: 
- Timing Feature
    - print time taken in console to retrieve quotes

- q.commands
    - send list of commands and descriptions

- Add info about the bot in readme
