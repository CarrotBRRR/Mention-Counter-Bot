+ [The Nog's] (⌨-general) bracken6504:
	Yeah and I can blame Intelligent Systems for that fucking outfit
+ [The Nog's] (⌨-general) bracken6504:
	Also ngl the concern/sorry here depends heavily on how you feel about Shinobu/Hachikuji/Sengoku etc

	And also if you read the books

	Because I'm going to be cleaning up these chats soon and deleting a lot of this haha

	i just wasnt sure cuz i was gonna link my own server which kind of feels like a shameless plug 😭
+ [The Nog's] (Kais repo lobby) jojk55555:
	Oh yeah if you are just straight up linking a server here is perfect, but since it's more of a loose invite revolving around repo it would be more suited for repo chat
+ [The Nog's] (Kais repo lobby) sylocket:
	gotchaa
+ [The Nog's] (Kais repo lobby) jojk55555:
	But you are welcome to post a server invite to yours in this chat 100% if you decide to throw one in here
+ [The Nog's] (Kais repo lobby) sylocket:
	thank you!
+ [The Nog's] (Kais repo lobby) jojk55555:
	That's up to you tho, if you would rather keep it loose then that is totally understandable
